# Description

oplzkwp is a self-modifying library for ELF obfuscation. It uses PRESENT and 
blake244 for encryption of the obfuscated code. Only the functions that are 
currently executed are being decrypted. Both Linux and Android are supported.

# Design

# How To

Modify payload.c to fit your needs. Constraints:

 *  Each function starting with "_e_" will be encrypted and decrypted at 
    run-time. This functions must not be re-entrant.

 *  Use decrypt_and_call(next) to call another _e_ function.
 
 *  Each functions needs to be page-aligned. 
    (see payload.c and  __attribute__((aligned(PAGE_SIZE))).

 *  The final executable must be compiled with -fpie (this is the default if 
    using the Makefile provided).
