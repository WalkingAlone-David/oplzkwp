# Description

oplzkwp is a library for ELF obfuscation. It uses PRESENT and blake244 to 
encrypt your payload on the fly. Only the functions that are currently 
executed are decrypted in memory. Both Linux and Android are supported.

# How To

Modify payload.c to fit your needs. Constraints:

 o  Each function starting with "_e_" will be encrypted and decrypted at 
    run-time.

 o  Use decrypt_and_call(next) to call another _e_ function. If the function
    is currently called (e.g., reentrant), a regular call must be done.
 
 o  Each functions needs to be page-aligned. 
    (see payload.c and  __attribute__((aligned(PAGE_SIZE))).

 o  The final executable must be compiled with -fpie (this is the default if 
    using the Makefile provided).

# Build

  o Linux, use "make". 

  o Android, use "make android" (You must have ndk-build setup).
    The executable will be in ./libs/armebi/

# Feeling lucky?
  
  Just run the provided ./oplzkwp
